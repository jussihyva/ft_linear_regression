# ft_linear_regression

## 1. Project descriptionn

## 1.1 Objective

The aim of this project is to introduce you to the basic concept behind machine learning. For this project, you will have to create a program that predicts the price of a car by using a [linear function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_function) train with a [gradient descent algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient_descent)

## 2. Prestudy

I started to learn (briefly) these three subjects to get overall understanding about the project:

- [Linear regression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regression#:~:text=In%20statistics%2C%20linear%20regression%20is,as%20dependent%20and%20independent%20variables\).&text=Such%20models%20are%20called%20linear%20models.)
- [linear function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_function)
- [gradient descent algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient_descent)
